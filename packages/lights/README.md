A [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) port of Kalle Hameleinen's Box2DLights.
`@box2d/lights` is a 2D lighting framework that uses [@box2d/core](https://github.com/lusito/box2d.ts) for raycasting and WebGL for rendering. This library can be used without [@box2d/core](https://github.com/lusito/box2d.ts), so if your 2D physics library supports raycasting, you might be able to use this as well.

## Features

 * Arbitrary number of lights
 * Gaussian blurred light maps
 * Point light
 * Cone Light
 * Directional Light
 * Chain Light [New in 1.3]
 * Shadows
 * Dynamic/static/xray light
 * Culling
 * Colored ambient light
 * Gamma corrected colors
 * Handler class to do all the work
 * Query method for testing is point inside of light/shadow

This library offer easy way to add soft dynamic 2d lights to your physic based game.

## Usage

TODO (see the testbed for simple examples)
